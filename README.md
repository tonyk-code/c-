#C++ Projects ‚Äì My First Year as a Programmer

Welcome to my C++ project collection! This repository showcases some of the projects I worked on during my first year of programming while learning C++. Each project helped me build a stronger understanding of the language, from basic syntax to more complex concepts like object-oriented programming and file handling.

## üß† What I Learned

Throughout these projects, I explored and practiced:

- Basic syntax and control structures
- Functions and scope
- Classes and object-oriented programming
- File I/O
- Debugging and problem-solving in C++

- ## üìÅ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tonyk-code/c-.git
